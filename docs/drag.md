## üîß Troubleshooting

### "Element won't drag"

- Make sure you're **clicking directly on the element** (text or image)
- **Hold** the mouse button down while dragging
- If stuck, try clicking the element first to select it

### "Element disappeared"

- It might be **outside the canvas boundaries**
- Click **Delete** button and add a new one
- Elements can't go off the canvas edges

### "Drag is too sensitive"

- This is normal - small mouse movements = precise positioning
- For big moves: drag quickly
- For fine-tuning: drag slowly

### "Can't stop dragging"

- Make sure you **release the mouse button**
- If stuck, press **Escape key** to cancel

### "Image is blurry"

- Upload a higher resolution image
- Avoid scaling images too large
- Use original size when possible

## üìã Quick Tips

### For Text Elements

- Use **large font sizes** for titles (60-80px)

### For Images/Signatures

- Always use **transparent background PNG**
